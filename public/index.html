<p>On Sunday, April 5, 2020, a global, open coalition emerged for digital contact tracing protocols to flatten the curve and stop the spread of COVID-19 while reopening the economy.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past few weeks, the global community of technologists, privacy experts, and epidemiologists have worked tirelessly towards a secure, privacy-first, GDPR-compliant and open-source approach to enable globally compatible contact tracing. Our goal is to flatten the curve of infections and re-infections in the COVID-19 epidemic. Scientific studies such as this study from <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/30/science.abb6936">Oxford</a> have shown that contact tracing can slow the spread of COVID-19 and help safely end lockdowns.</p>
<p>Our first and foremost goal is to get secure tracing apps running on billions of users’ devices globally — fast. The TCN Coalition’s easy-to-implement privacy-first protocol, agreed and reviewed by dozens of experts, is open-source, extensible, and free of charge, and is available for implementation immediately. TCN - the core of the protocol - stands for temporary contact number. This completely anonymous number is generated to privately record interactions between compatible mobile devices without allowing them to be tracked. </p>
<p>We urge all major technology companies, app developers and governments to implement apps compatible with this shared protocol. We welcome other groups engaged in similar efforts to join us at <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/30/science.abb6936">TCN-coalition.org</a>. We also encourage any other contact tracing coalitions to adopt similarly secure privacy-first protocols.</p>
