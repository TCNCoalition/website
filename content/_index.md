## About Us

Founded in April 2020, the TCN Coalition is a global community of technologists united by the mission to support exposure notification apps during the COVID-19 pandemic. The TCN Coalition believes that exposure notification apps must be interoperable, trusted by the public, and privacy-preserving to quickly and safely reduce the need for lockdowns. 

We achieve this mission through several efforts: connecting and educating app developers about navigating the public health environment, assisting public health agencies in understanding how to deploy this technology safely and effectively, and supporting exposure notification apps with open source software.

## The Challenge

Many different groups have sprung up to either enable or build out exposure notification applications since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.

These organizations span the globe and many of them have overlapping missions and work. On top of that, they are largely focused on their own product and are not thinking about the broader ecosystem, including how interoperability between these systems might work. 

The TCN Coalition serves as a gathering place to increase visibility across the ecosystem, allowing for better communication, more effective use of resources, and faster delivery of effective exposure notification solutions as a result.

## What the TCN Coalition Provides

> - **Affiliate Services.** We support all privacy-preserving exposure notification apps, no matter which protocol they are being built upon. We provide education, networking, and expert advice to member teams looking to build out exposure notification apps. 
> - **Public Health Department Education.** We help public health organizations navigate this space through education, networking, and expert advice on exposure notification apps. 
> - **Exposure Notification App Support.** Our Coalition members contribute open source solutions, ranging from backend reference implementations to frontend app code that can be used by anyone.
